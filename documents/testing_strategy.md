## 4. Testing Strategy Principles

### Unit Testing

- Granular testing of individual functions
- 100% coverage for critical path logic
- Emphasis on pure function testing
- TDD approach for core business logic

### Integration Testing

- Verify interactions between components
- Test API endpoints thoroughly
- Validate database interactions
- Ensure consistent data flow

### BDD Approach

- Cucumber.js for scenario-based testing
- User-centric test scenarios
- Living documentation of system behaviour
- Bridges communication between stakeholders

### Performance Considerations

- Response time targets:
    - API: < 200ms
    - Complex queries: < 500ms
- Scalability testing
- Resource utilization monitoring

### Security Testing

- OWASP top 10 vulnerability checks
- JWT authentication testing
- Input validation
- Rate limiting verification

## 4. Continuous Integration Workflow

### GitHub Actions Pipeline

1. Code Commit Stage
   - Lint checks
   - Unit tests
   - Code coverage report

2. Pull Request Stage
   - Integration tests
   - Security scans
   - Performance benchmarks

3. Pre-Deployment Stage
   - Full test suite
   - End-to-end testing
   - Accessibility checks

## 5. Future Expansion Strategy

### Scalability Considerations

- Modular test structure
- Easy integration of new test types
- Minimal maintenance overhead
- Adaptable to growing project complexity

### Recommended Enhancements

- Mutation testing
- Advanced performance profiling
- Comprehensive accessibility testing
- Machine learning-assisted test generation

## 6. Non-Functional Testing

### Performance Metrics

- Response time tracking
- Resource utilization
- Concurrent user simulation

### Accessibility

- WCAG 2.1 compliance
- Screen reader compatibility
- Color contrast validation

### Cross-Browser/Device Testing

- Responsive design verification
- Browser compatibility matrix
- Mobile device performance

## Conclusion

A holistic, adaptable testing strategy that ensures high-quality, reliable software delivery while maintaining development agility.
