# Sk8Meet Architecture Document

## 1. Executive Summary

Sk8Meet is a comprehensive platform designed to transform how street skating events are organized, promoted, and experienced. This document outlines the architectural approach for implementing Sk8Meet as a mobile-first, cost-effective solution that meets the needs of skating communities worldwide.

For a detailed understanding of our testing strategy, tools, and approach, please refer to our [Detailed Testing Strategy](./detailed_testing_strategy.md), which provides comprehensive insights into our testing methodology.

The architecture is designed with the following key principles in mind:

- Simplicity and understandability for developers with various experience levels
- Cost-effective deployment and hosting
- Hosting provider independence through containerization
- Mobile-first approach with cross-platform support
- Limited tech stack diversity to simplify development and maintenance
- Clear separation of frontend and backend concerns
- Infrastructure as code for consistent, repeatable deployments
- DevOps practices for efficient development and deployment workflows

The recommended architecture is a **modular monolith** with clear separation of concerns, deployed as containerized applications with a managed database service. A modular monolith is a single deployable unit that contains clearly defined internal modules with well-established boundaries, allowing for simpler development and deployment while maintaining good separation of concerns. This approach balances simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and flexibility for future growth, while minimizing the complexity that would come with a microservices architecture.

        ES --> MS
        ES --> RS
        MS --> RS
    end
```

#### Key Backend Components

1. **API Gateway**: Entry point for all API requests, handles routing, authentication, and basic validation
2. **User & Organization Module**: Manages user accounts, authentication, organizations, roles, and permissions
3. **Event Module**: Handles event creation, management, and notifications
4. **Marshal Module**: Manages marshal availability, assignments, and qualifications
5. **Route Module**: Handles route planning, storage, and integration with mapping services
6. **Community Module**: Manages participant engagement, feedback, and social features

#### Module Communication

Modules will communicate through the following patterns:

1. **Direct Method Calls**: For synchronous communication within the monolith
2. **Event-Driven Communication**: For asynchronous processes and loose coupling
3. **Well-Defined Interfaces**: Clear contracts between modules to enable future separation

### Data Architecture

The data architecture will use a relational database with a clear schema that respects module boundaries. This approach provides:

1. **Data Integrity**: Enforced relationships and constraints
2. **Query Flexibility**: Complex queries across related data
3. **Transaction Support**: ACID properties for critical operations
4. **Familiar Technology**: Well-understood by most developers

#### Database Schema Organization

To enforce clear ownership boundaries at the database level, each module will have its own database schema:

```sql
-- User Management module tables in their own schema
CREATE SCHEMA user_management;

CREATE TABLE user_management.users (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  -- other fields
);

-- Event Management module tables in their own schema
CREATE SCHEMA event_management;

CREATE TABLE event_management.events (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  creator_id UUID NOT NULL,
  -- other fields
);
```

This schema-based approach provides several benefits:

- Clear visual separation of tables by module
- Database permissions can be set at the schema level
- Schema name provides namespace to avoid table name collisions
- Makes it easier to extract a module to its own database later if needed
- Query analyzers and tools can easily show which module owns which tables

#### Referential Integrity Approach

A **Hybrid Approach** will be used to implement referential integrity across module boundaries:

1. **Within Module Boundaries**:
   - Database-level foreign keys for strong referential integrity
   - Full ACID transaction support
   - Example: Events referencing other events within the event_management schema

2. **Across Module Boundaries**:
   - Application-level integrity checks for looser coupling
   - Database constraints (like NOT NULL) where appropriate
   - Example: Events referencing users from the user_management schema

```sql
-- Example of hybrid approach
CREATE TABLE event_management.events (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  creator_id UUID NOT NULL, -- References user but without DB-level foreign key
  parent_event_id UUID,
  -- other fields
  FOREIGN KEY (parent_event_id) REFERENCES event_management.events(id) -- Within-module FK
);
```

The application will enforce cross-module integrity through service-layer checks:

```typescript
// In event-management/services/eventService.ts
async function createEvent(eventData) {
  // Check if user exists (cross-module integrity check)
  const userExists = await userService.userExists(eventData.creatorId);
  if (!userExists) {
    throw new Error('User not found');
  }
  
  // Continue with event creation...
  return eventRepository.createEvent(eventData);
}
```

This hybrid approach balances strong data integrity with the flexibility needed for future evolution of the architecture.
