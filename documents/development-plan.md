# Sk8Meet Development Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the recommended development approach, technology stack, and implementation strategy for the Sk8Meet platform. Based on the project requirements and architecture documents, we've designed a plan that minimizes software installation on developer machines while ensuring consistent development environments across all platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS).

For a comprehensive understanding of our testing methodology, tools, and approach, please refer to our [Detailed Testing Strategy](./detailed_testing_strategy.md), which provides an in-depth overview of our testing principles and implementation.

## Development Approach

### Core Principles

1. **Containerized Development**
   - Docker-based development environment to ensure consistency
   - Minimal local installation requirements (only Docker and VS Code)
   - Cross-platform compatibility for all developer machines

2. **DevOps-First Methodology**
   - Infrastructure as code from day one
   - Automated testing and deployment pipelines
   - Consistent environments across development, staging, and production

3. **Modular Monolith Architecture**
   - Clear separation of concerns with well-defined module boundaries
   - Single deployment unit for simplicity
   - Designed for potential future extraction of services if needed

4. **Mobile-First Design**
   - Progressive Web App (PWA) approach for cross-platform support
   - Offline capabilities for marshals in the field
   - Responsive design for all screen sizes
